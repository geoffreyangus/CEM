In class, you learned about the four fundamental variable types: Integer, Float, String, and Boolean. You also learned about the Python Interpreter. This assignment goes through several exercises that will give you a better understanding of these concepts.

(rough draft)

1. What happens if you divide an integer by an integer?

(you get a float)

2. What happens if you divide an integer by a string?

(you get an error)

3. What happens if you add together two strings?

('a' + 'b' = 'ab')

4. What happens if you add the boolean `True` to an integer

(it increments by one. This is because of how booleans are stored in memory)


etc. etc. I think these questions are good because they make the student comfortable with the interpreter, while getting them to start using operators.
