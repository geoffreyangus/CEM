We are two Computer Science students from Stanford University who have received fellowships through the Haas Center of Public Service. We are bringing four years of collective experience in introductory computer science education with us to Curitiba, where we will be implementing a Computer Science curriculum built specifically for introducing passionate high school students to the world of research at a University level.

Hello! My name is Geoff Angus and I am a student at Stanford University studying Computer Science. First and foremost, I am a Californian and an avid musician. I am also a rock climber and have climbed everywhere from Yosemite, Joshua Tree, and Fontainebleau in France. Some of my favorite things are dogs, comic books, and food!
At school, I am specializing in Artificial Intelligence and have worked on research projects such as smartwatch gesture recognition and carotid ultrasound abnormality detection throughout my time at Stanford.
I have been teaching introductory computer science courses at Stanford for over 2 years and am excited to get to work with you all in Brazil.  We’ve put together an incredible set of projects for you to get started on software-enabled research and we are incredibly excited for you to get started. Até breve!

Hi everyone! I’m Sabri Eyuboglu, and I’m coming to Colegio Bom Jesus in July to teach an introductory Computer Science course! 
I’ll be coming to Curitiba from my home just outside Boston, Massachusetts. Being from Boston, I’m a huge sports fan, and I love watching soccer with my family on the weekends. In my free time, I like to play basketball or soccer with friends, and go running in the woods near my home. Most of all, I love any and all activities in the mountains: skiing, hiking, biking, you name it. 
Like Geoff, I’ve been teaching computer science at Stanford for a a few years now, and I’m incredibly excited to bring an introductory computer science class to Bom Jesus. At Stanford, I’m studying computer science focusing on Machine Learning and Data Science. I’m looking forward to sharing my excitement for computer science and machine learning with all of you this winter!
